# Data_Structure
知耻而后勇，在补坑的路上学习巩固。
没有想到机考的时候连平常一次过的循环队列都要打几遍才过，学得不好是真的。
Sad about my data structure exam on cyclic queue, so do it after I realize it.
## Ordinary Organization
--> Data_Structure

----> *_S: achieve the data structure with static array.

----> *_D: achieve the data structure with dynamic array.

----> *_L: achieve the data structure with list.

## Special Organization
--> Data_Structure

----> Queue_C: achieve queue with cyclic array. (Therefore, Queue_D doesn't exist.)
## UI
try to finish it after finishing all data structures I have learned.
